              "A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.",

              "Firewalls can be hardware-based, software-based, or a combination of both.",
              "They work by examining network traffic and blocking or allowing it based on configured rules, often involving source and destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.",
              "Firewalls help protect against unauthorized access, malware, and other cyber threats.",
              "Stateful firewalls keep track of the state of network connections and make decisions based on the context of the traffic.",
              "Next-generation firewalls (NGFWs) offer more advanced features like intrusion prevention, application control, and deep packet inspection."
