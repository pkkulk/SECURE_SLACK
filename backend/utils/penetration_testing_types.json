            "**Black Box Testing:** The tester has no prior knowledge of the target system, simulating an external attacker.",
            "**White Box Testing:** The tester has full knowledge of the target system, including architecture, source code, and credentials. This allows for a more thorough analysis.",
            "**Gray Box Testing:** The tester has partial knowledge of the target system, striking a balance between black box and white box testing.",
            "**External Penetration Testing:** Focuses on externally facing infrastructure like websites, email servers, and DNS servers.",
            "**Internal Penetration Testing:** Simulates an attack from within the organization's network, often to assess the risk from malicious insiders.",
            "**Blind Testing:** The security team is aware the test is occurring but has limited information about the tester's activities.",
            "**Double-Blind Testing:** Most of the security team is unaware of the test, providing a more realistic assessment of their response capabilities.",
            "**Web Application Penetration Testing:** Specifically targets web applications to identify vulnerabilities in their code, logic, and infrastructure.",
            "**Network Penetration Testing:** Assesses the security of network devices, servers, and overall network architecture.",
            "**Wireless Penetration Testing:** Focuses on identifying weaknesses in Wi-Fi networks and wireless devices.",
            "**Social Engineering Penetration Testing:** Evaluates the susceptibility of employees to manipulation tactics.",
            "**Physical Penetration Testing:** Attempts to breach physical security controls like locks, cameras, and access control systems.",
            "**Cloud Penetration Testing:** Specifically designed to assess the security of cloud-based environments and services.",
            "**Mobile Application Penetration Testing:** Focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in mobile applications on platforms like Android and iOS."
